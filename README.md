# taskday8 - K-Means clustering groups data points based on similarity, iteratively assigning them to clusters with the nearest centroid. The Elbow Method helps determine the optimal number of clusters by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) and identifying the "bend" in the graph. However, K-Means has limitations—it struggles with non-spherical clusters, is sensitive to outliers, and relies on a pre-defined K. Initialization affects results since poor starting points can lead to suboptimal clustering. Inertia measures how tightly points are clustered, with lower values indicating better grouping. Silhouette Score evaluates cluster separation, with values closer to 1 indicating distinct groups. The best K is chosen based on the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and domain understanding. Unlike classification, clustering is unsupervised and doesn’t rely on labeled data—it finds inherent patterns instead of predicting pre-defined categories.
